            <h3>Academic Research</h3>
            <p>The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic threatens the lives of millions of people worldwide. This threat is not just at the health level but is a ripple effect due to the epidemic crisis. Many countries have taken emergency measures to address the impact of the epidemic. UNESCO estimates that more than 1.5 billion students in 165 countries are out of school due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The epidemic has forced the global academic community to explore new ways of teaching and learning, including distance and online education. It has proven to be a challenge for students and educators alike, who must cope with the psychological, physical, and financial hardships of the disease while doing their part to help curb the spread of the virus. The future is uncertain for everyone, especially for the millions of students scheduled to graduate this year, who will face a world of economic distress due to the epidemic.</p>
